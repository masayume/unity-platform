         * Big Eye - the cyclops jumping robot springs in the direction of Mega Man trying to squash him. 
         * In the NES game I believe his jumping between low and high is random but this replica follows 
         * the jump patterns published in the Mega Man Maker wiki. Reason I chose patterns has to do with 
         * potential obstacles in his path. He could randomly pick low jumps many times and not clear the 
         * objects making it look uhhh ooookay. By using the patterns at most it could be two low jumps 
         * then finally being a high jump and clearing the object in question (unless it's taller than 
         * his jump height of course). 
         * 
         * How this works
         * 
         * While grounded he has no velocity therefore stands still. There is a jump timer that counts 
         * down and once times up looks into performing the jump, however before doing so he checks whether 
         * he is already following a pattern or is it time to pick a new one at random. Once the pattern 
         * is chosen the velocity for that jump is fetched. The player's x position is used to determine 
         * whether he needs to jump left or right. Right of the player, jump left x *= -1, right being 
         * positive, no change in x velocity. Increment through the pattern index each jump and if the 
         * last is reached then null the pattern telling Big Eye on next pass to pick a new random pattern.
         * 
         * While jumping he uses a constant x velocity to be able to pass objects that initially block his 
         * path. Originally I used AddForce but as soon as something opposes his forward momentum it's lost. 
         * Now constant velocity is used to fix that issue. The isJumping flag is for playing the jump landed 
         * sound in FixedUpdate once isGrounded is set from raycast collision with the Ground layer. This is 
         * exactly like in the Player code for Mega Man's jump landing audio. Last he checks whether he needs 
         * to face the opposite direction. Unlike the other enemies that face a constant direction, Big Eye 
         * checks where the player is and jumps in his direction, so no SetMovementDirection function. The 
         * x velocity is tested for being less than zero, meaning, he's jumping left. We use the same logic 
         * as with the other enemies to change the facing direction if needed.
